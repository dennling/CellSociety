Today we talked about duplicated code and analyzed several classes from both of our projects that contained lines of duplicated code.
First, we went over the XML parser classes that Yilin coded and realized that she could create two classes to perform similar tasks.
This would cut down on 6-8 lines of duplicated code in her XML classes.
We then went over several of her "Page" classes that were slightly trickier to optimize. 
We decided that again we could split one or two duplications into different methods, but also we could re-hash the entire class and  add different functionality to reduce redundancy.
We then went over my (Dennis') code for the game logic. We decided that a major change I could make was the compression of gameLogic in Wator.
I ended up creating a looping method for our checks that cut my gameLogic class lines.
We then realized I could create a method in my super class to eliminate 4x duplicated code for setting up my default cell types. 
I just used if statements in my superclass in order to handle the cases for each simulation.

All in all it was a cool lab where we were able to talk about different types of implementations and realize how to optimize our code.
